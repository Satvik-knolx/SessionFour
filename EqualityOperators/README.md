# EqualityOperator
This is a Scala class that provides methods for checking the equality of string variables using different operators. It can be used in scenarios where string comparison is needed, and different types of operators can be used. The class defines the following methods:


# equals: 
A method that is used to compare the contents of two objects for equality. It is defined in the java.lang.Object class and is overridden in many classes to provide customized equality checks. This method returns a boolean value of true if the contents of both objects are equal, and false otherwise.

# ==: 
A binary operator that is used to compare two objects for equality. It is equivalent to calling the equals method on the left-hand object, passing the right-hand object as an argument. This operator returns a boolean value of true if the objects are equal, and false otherwise.

# !=: 
A binary operator that is used to compare two objects for inequality. It is equivalent to negating the result of the == operator. This operator returns a boolean value of true if the objects are not equal, and false otherwise.

# ne: 
A method that is used to compare the identity of two objects. It returns a boolean value of true if the objects are not identical, and false otherwise. This method is rarely used in practice, as it is often more appropriate to use the == or equals operators to compare objects.

# eq: 
A method that is used to compare the identity of two objects. It returns a boolean value of true if the objects are identical, and false otherwise. This method is rarely used in practice, as it is often more appropriate to use the == or equals operators to compare objects.
